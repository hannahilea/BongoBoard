BongoBoard is the world's ~~first~~ ~~[second](https://www.reddit.com/r/badUIbattles/comments/gha25t/ascii_input_keyboard_the_binary_bongos/)~~ [umpteenth](https://medium.com/@jam1garner/how-i-turned-my-dk-bongos-into-a-keyboard-897299f71835) bongo-based human computer interface! Much like a stenographer's chorded [stenotype keyboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenotype) enables realtime transcription, this unchorded [bongo board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameCube_accessories#DK_Bongos) facilitates computer input at up to X BPM (bongos per minute)---not to mention its yell modifier! 

Future input modes may include:
- `morse code` mode: drum your message madly!
- `binary` mode: drum your bytes madly!
- `git` mode: you drummed your changes, now drum your commit!
- `mouse` mode: drum to control the mouse!


### Dev notes

Under active ideation, as part of a creative coding exercise at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/)! Language itself not yet created (where "yet" is the operative word). Stay tuned! :D
